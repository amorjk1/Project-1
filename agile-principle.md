## Working software

One of the Agile Manifesto is produce a working software even if its finished or not, thats why our first task was to get the software from previous developers and get it working. This is very important for us to do so that we don't have to start from the beginning. This also means that we are progressing with the project.

## Customer collaboration

Everytime we finish something in the app, we always made sure that the customer knows about it as it will help us get a feedback from them on what they think about what we have done in the project, either they like it or not; its a feedback and we can improve on from there.

## Responding to change

Around Thursday, March 19 2020; we received an email from our customer giving us feedback about what needs to be changed on the app. This was 5 days before the national lockdown so we only had few days to actually work on it before getting locked out of school. I knew this would be a problem for me because I was having problem running react-native on my home device so I need to get this done within this time frame. I managed to get the "About us" page and Aisea managed to fix the login button for the users to navigate easily.

## Individuals and interactions

One of the 12 principles of agile manifesto is to check on teammates and reflects on how to become more effective.

>At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly.

So we made sure that we do stand up meetings often like what in the picture below. This way we can talk about what needs to be done asap and what else we need to do in the future.

We also made sure that we have meetings during lockdown so Grayson set up a zoom meeting for us to catch up of what we're upto in the project even for a short amount of time.
