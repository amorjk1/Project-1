## Sprint 1

### Create Account - User story

How I created the login page and the registration page is pretty basic, this was a good start for learning routes and controllers in Laravel.

[link](https://github.com/SoftEnOP/op-stats-thelionkings/commit/d5e58ade1d4802633cc0fcb1abd2c2380ee6211a) for the codes on how I made the login page and registration page.

This is how the website checks the user if its using a proper account from the database, if not; it will throw an error that says "The email or password is incorrect, please try again". If the log in is successful then the user will be redirected to home page.

This function is built-in with Laravel.

Then I added the error message by using partials.

the code from above is the code that will throw the error message when triggered. Then I just included this into the page where I want the error message to pop up. Examples below:

I also made sure that the website will keep the credentials when they type their password wrong on both registration page and logging in page.

## Sprint 2

### Deleting Account

On this sprint, I got very motivated to do my task becuase im getting the hang of using Laravel, and I also found a very good tutorial on how to do my issue. I have managed to almost finish my task within two days.

and this is how I changed the roles for the users by using the admin account

![update](https://i.imgur.com/AGgKwZW.png)

During our class, Martin and Elise addressed an issue where you can just check our logging in credentials by just typing the address on the url. We fixed this issue by hiding our .env file from public.

I also learned how to use seeder in this [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejiyXWSsdGk&list=PLxFwlLOncxFLazmEPiB4N0iYc3Dwst6m4&index=6)

And I reliaze that its gonna be an issue if you can see the manage users button even if you are a normal user, so I updated the page by disabling the "manage the user" button for the normal user.

This is how I did the authentication of the admin account

![auth](https://i.imgur.com/xM0WNXR.png)

then on the navbar page, I check if the user has the admin role. If the user doesn't have the admin role, it will disable the "manage users" button.

This is what the normal user's view of the website.

And this is what admin see's when they log in.

## Sprint 3

### Login Pop Up

My task on this sprint is to do my backlog from the previous sprint. This time I had to put the login page as a pop up instead of having its own page as the customer requested. Even though I think it's unnecessary but as agile as I am, I accepted changes from the customer.

What I did is I just put use modal and put it on the navbar page and put the whole page into that modal.

## Sprint 4

### Error message logging in

On this sprint, We were just touching up our own portfolio. Martin addressed an issue where he couldn't log in on our website, this is due to our own mistake by redoing our database so the account that Martin made before got wiped with it. I suggested that he makes another account again and assured him that our mistake wont happen again. He also mentioned that it doesn't throw any error message when he fails to log in. It is because my error message was on the same log in modal. I fixed it by putting the error message into home page because thats where the users get redirected when they fail logging in. See evidence below.

This is where I commented out the error partials from the navbar

and this is where I put the error message for the user to see when the login modal closes.

## Sprint 5

### Disable user account

On this sprint, I got assigned on disabling user. I achieved this by making another column on the user table called "banned_until" and check the present date and the banned_until if the difference between them is positive then disable the account for that amount of time.

![ban](https://i.imgur.com/2qETb6C.png)

then add the error message on the partials that I have made earlier this semester.

![partial](https://i.imgur.com/pWmWIp6.png)

but at this point, banning will only work if you got to the main database website and ban the user from there which is not efficient. To fix this, made a button inside the admin page and then I also made another column called "ban_status" then it will check the users "banned_until" if the present date is less than then it will set the account to 1 which is disable, if not then it will set the ban_status into 0.
