### First Week

I didnt really have a main objective on our first week as it was just pretty much an introduction of the paper although we already managed to get a first look on our project and met my groups. We also managed to make some user stories for our client to review on for the project.

### Second Week

On our second week of the semester (06/08/2019), We started doing the [tutorial](https://appdividend.com/2018/09/06/laravel-5-7-crud-example-tutorial/) about Laravel. My main objective on this week was to learn more on MVC Architecture and make sure that most of our user stories are approved by the client which is Martin at this point.

### First Sprint

Our first sprint wasn't too bad as we managed to finish all our user stories that we needed to do. I also managed to create the login and registration page. I now understand how to get around the Laravel layout such as controller, views, database and web.php which is what I wanted to do as my goal for this sprint as I know that it will help me alot in the future.

### Second Sprint

On our second sprint, I wanted to focus more on resolving local environment issues faster as I got stuck for a bit in solving my issues. I also realized that our workload isn't balanced as Nick did alot of work on our first sprint so I want to address this to our team and make sure that we talk about balancing workload within the group. I want to look more into database migrations and seeding so that I dont have to keep on repopulating our database manually.

### Third Sprint

My objective this Sprint would be; Urge the group to do more stand up meetings as we lack of it last sprint and it made our job quite slow. I also want to improve on my Laravel skills as I still struggle understanding about migrations.

### Fourth Sprint

This sprint was a short sprint as it was 1 week shorter than usual because of the holiday, but that didn't stop me from learning. I made sure that around holidays I made my goal to learn more about github.

### Fifth Sprint

On our last sprint, my goal was to finish the rest of the project and make sure that everthing works perfectly and as intended. I also wanted to assign even share of work to everyone.
