### Changes

As the semester starts, Martin told us what the project would be like. Then after a week or so, he mentioned that we will be changing our customer and that customer would be Hymie, we quickly made an appointment with him to talk about what he wants about the website as we're kinda not sure if he will have the same vision on the website the same as Martin. This is a good opportunity to exercise one of the agile principle, welcoming changes in the project.

### Deliver Frequently and Face-to-Face Time

On our second meeting with our client, We showed Hymie what we had done from that current sprint. What we had wasn't good as it was pretty simple and plain as it is our first sprint, but because we had something to show the customer; we were able to get more ideas of what the customer wants as he can just point on something infront of him instead of us imagining what he wants. 

### Build Projects

*Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done*

This principle did not work very well as one of our member doesn't really do much as the others. We tried splitting the task evenly but always ends up for other members to do others job. 

Our team and Martin came up with a solution to give that member the minimum task for the sprint as it will help us focus more on the main part of the website and even if he doesn't do his job, we can still finish a big chunk of the software.

### Reflect for Effectiveness

On our second to the last of the sprint, we had an issue with one of our member as that member doesn't really do much of his work on time and makes us delayed with our work. We decided to give that member an issue that doesn't need collaboration with us, this way we can all work on something at the same time without holding back a member.

### Face-to-Face Time

As the sprint goes by, Our team became more efficient in our time management and consistency. We had a meeting with Hymie every fortnite. We try to do as much communication within our group and with the customer as possible.

### Measure of Progress

Having a working product is one of the agile principle, to make sure that we have the working software only running on our live server, We decided to do a different branch called "Development" as it will help us improve the website without breaking the proper live server.
