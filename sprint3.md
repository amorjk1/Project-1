# Sprint 3

## Introduction

This sprint was very productive for me, I added the "about us" page and email Josh Perry for the infornation we are about to put in that page such as pictures and other information about the app.

## What worked for me?

Although the previous developers code is quite all over the place, I managed to get it around my head and add another page for the app and the client is pretty happy with it.

## What do I need to improve on?

I need to improve on completing the task faster and get used to working in schedule. 

## What were the barriers?

I had some problems installing React-native on my home computer so I had to go to school just to work on this project.

## What do I need to do for the next sprint?

I will be focusing on fixing the profile page and improve the aesthetic of it.
