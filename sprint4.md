## Introduction

At this point, it was hard for us to get something going with the project because of corona, we were still keeping in touch within the group and try to follow up what needs to be done and what other people has done for this project.

## What worked for me?

Communicating with the project leader and the tutor, we still did a few stand up meetings through zoom even on lockdown.

## What were the barriers?

I had an issue with my home computer so I couldnt do anything project related and had to wait to get an access to school computers.
