## Introduction

We managed to get the repository for the application but we couldn't figure out which directory is the working one. I had to message the previous developer for the app for us to get the proper application location and get started.

## What worked for me?

Communication worked well for me specially with the previous developer of the app, it helped us alot configuring the previous problem.

## What do I need to improve on?

I really need to focus on what I am currently doing because I always get distracted on to doing something else instead of my goals. 

## What were the barriers?

Getting the application to run on my personal device, it took me a while for me to get used to it without asking my colleague's help.

## What do I need to do for the next sprint?

Communicate with Renz and get the credentialz for the account that they used to publish the app so that we can access the database for this app.
