# Sprint 1

## Introduction

Our first sprint was just to get used to using React-Native and the installation of the other platform such as node.js.

## What worked for me?

One of the things that worked for me is communication within the team, I've been in the same class as Aisea most of the time and Ryann is a cool guy. 

## What do I need to improve on?

I need to improve on my coding skills as I got a little bit rusty with it, also need to improve on my research skills because im learning a new coding language for this project.

## What were the barriers?

We had to wait for the gitlab repo to go up and took them a while before we can actually do something with the app.

## What do I need to do for the next sprint?

Read more about React-native, learn about node.js and get used to this kind of environment.
